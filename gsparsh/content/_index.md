subtitle: "I'm a data scientist passionate about using data to solve complex challenges across disciplines."
description: "When I'm not crunching numbers, you can find me sipping on an iced aeropress, debating philosophical concepts, or getting lost in a good book while Coco, my golden retriever, snoozes at my feet. I'm a sucker for classic literature, biographies, and philosophical musings, and I love unwinding with a Hindi comedy or a thought-provoking documentary"
